        "Ans-Modularity: Functions enable you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. By dividing your program into modular functions, each responsible for a specific task, you can enhance readability, understandability, and organization of your code. Modularity also facilitates collaboration among multiple developers working on different parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away the implementation details of a particular functionality. By defining a function with a descriptive name, you create a high-level interface that hides the underlying complexity. This makes your code more readable and helps other programmers understand the purpose and usage of the function without delving into its internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code organization: Functions provide a structured way to organize your code. By grouping related code into functions, you can achieve better code organization and separation of concerns. This makes it easier to navigate, debug, and maintain your codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reusability and maintenance: Functions promote code reusability, as mentioned earlier, by allowing you to call the same block of code from multiple places. This makes it easier to make changes or fix bugs since you only need to modify the function's implementation instead of every place where the code is duplicated. Functions also enhance code maintenance by isolating changes within a specific function, reducing the impact on other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Functions allow you to encapsulate data and behavior within a self-contained unit. By defining function parameters and return values, you can control the input and output of a function, limiting the scope of variables and preventing unintended side effects. This helps in creating more robust and predictable code."
