        "Mutability: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified after creation. You can add, remove, or change elements within a list. On the other hand, tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified. Tuples are fixed in size and cannot be changed.\n",

        "Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: Lists are commonly used for storing and manipulating collections of related items where the order matters and where modifications are needed. Tuples, on the other hand, are often used for grouping related elements together, especially when those elements have a specific relationship or represent different aspects of a single entity. Tuples are often used to represent immutable sequences, such as coordinates, database records, or function arguments.\n",

        "Performance: Tuples are generally more lightweight and faster to access compared to lists. Since tuples are immutable, Python can optimize memory usage and perform certain operations more efficiently.
