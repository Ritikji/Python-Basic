        "Ans-Generators and iterators are closely related concepts in Python. In fact, generators are a specific type of iterator. To understand their relationship, let's first define each concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterators: Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods: __iter__() and __next__(). The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next value from the iterator. Iterators are used to represent a stream of data or a sequence of values that can be iterated one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators: Generators are a special type of iterator that can be created using generator functions or generator expressions. Generator functions are defined using the def keyword but use the yield statement instead of return to produce a series of values. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over to retrieve the generated values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key relationships between generators and iterators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are Iterators: All generators are iterators because they implement the iterator protocol. This means that generator objects have the __iter__() and __next__() methods required by iterators. Therefore, you can use a generator wherever an iterator is expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit Iteration: Generators provide a convenient and concise way to create iterators without explicitly implementing the __iter__() and __next__() methods. The yield statement in a generator function automatically handles the state and value generation, making it easier to create iterable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators enable lazy evaluation, which means they produce values on-demand as they are iterated over. The next value is generated only when requested, which can save memory and improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suspension and Resumption: Generator functions can suspend their execution and save their internal state when encountering a yield statement. When the generator is iterated again, it resumes from where it left off, allowing for the generation of the next value.\n",

        "Lazy evaluation: Generator functions enable lazy evaluation, meaning that they produce values on-demand as they are iterated over. The next value is generated only when requested, allowing for efficient memory usage and potentially infinite sequences.\n",

Each time a value is yielded, the function's execution is temporarily halted, and it resumes from where it left off when the next value is requested."

When the yield statement is encountered, the current state of the function is frozen, and the specified value is returned to the caller.
