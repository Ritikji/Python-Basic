        "\n",
        "By importing PyInputPlus as \"pypi,\" developers can use the shorter alias when accessing the library's functions and methods. For example, instead of writing pyinputplus.inputInt(), they can simply write pypi.inputInt(). This can make the code more readable and easier to write.\n",

        "However, it's important to note that the choice of alias is not restricted to \"pypi.\" Developers can choose any valid name as the alias when importing a module using the import statement in Python. The choice of alias is a matter of personal preference and coding style."
